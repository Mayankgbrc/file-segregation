# file-segregation
As our Downloads/any folder contains various types of files such as images, videos, documents, etc, but to manually segregate the similar format to a particular folder is a tough process.To make this a fun task I will  teach you to develop a File Segregation to separate the different types of file formats to different Folders, like all the jpg, png, gif, tiff files to image folder, and just like doc, pdf, xlsx files to a document folder and more like this in one single click. And also stores the data in Database.
